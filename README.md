# Start a conversation
Want better team performance and well-being? Start a conversation to understand where you are today, and discover opportunities for improvement. The questions on [https://conversations.dora.dev](conversations.dora.dev) don't have easy answers. They're meant to provoke discussions among your team, or individual reflection. Use them as part of your journey of continuous improvement!

### Implementation
This site uses [Svelte 5](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/milestone/9), which (as of March 2024) is a pre-release version of the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) javascript framework.
> Why use a pre-release version? Because [Dave](https://github.com/davidstanke) wanted to try it out. It seems to be working okay. I hope?

### Hosting
The site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
